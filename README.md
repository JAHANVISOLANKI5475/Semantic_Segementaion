# Semantic_Segementaion
The aim of semantic image segmentation is to classify each pixel of an image. Image 
segmentation is a computer vision task which involves labelling various regions of the image 
into objects that are present in it. In this post, we will discuss how to use deep convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) for the task of semantic image segmentation
